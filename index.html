            <p>
                I am a student in the <strong>Faculty of Information Security and Networking</strong>. 
                My fields of study are <strong>networks</strong>, <strong>system administration</strong>,  
                <strong>ethical hacking</strong>, and, but not less important, <strong>programming</strong>. 
                Since college enrollment, I’ve been learning to program in different 
                languages like <strong>python</strong>, <strong>java</strong>, 
                <strong>C</strong>, <strong>SQL</strong>, etc. Besides programming, 
                I’ve created <strong>enterprise-type networks</strong> (wired and wireless) 
                with <strong>CISCO devices</strong>, <strong>Aruba APs</strong> and <strong>Linux Servers</strong>. 
                I have participated in college affairs by being a member of the Student Society. 
                I have managed <strong>Linux servers</strong> and <strong>Windows servers</strong>. 
                I also have analyzed multiple <strong>virtual machines</strong> to exploit them.

            <h1>Hobbies</h1>
            <p>
                In my spare time I like watching <strong>anime</strong> and <strong>movies</strong>. 
                I really like going to the <strong>movies</strong>. 
                I also like <strong>videogames</strong> and <strong>painting</strong> or <strong>drawing</strong>. 
                However, I don’t have much time for these last two things. When I’m not in school and I’m on the computer, 
                I like to learn new things like new <strong>programming languages</strong> or things about other kinds of topics. 
                I like to practice my programming skills doing projects on my own. 
                Finally, in my leisure time I usually go out to have fun with my <strong>friends</strong>.
